They like to pee and poop in the same place every time, so in most cases all you have to do is put a little bit of their waste in the litter box and they will happily use the litter box. It is very important that if they go somewhere else, miss the edge or kick waste out of the box that you clean it up well and immediately as otherwise those spots will become existing places to pee and poop. When you clean the box, save a little bit of waste and put it in the cleaned box so it smells right to them. For a more foolproof method, you can get a piece of wood soaked with their urine and put that in the box along with droppings or cage them so that they are only in their litter box for a week. Generally, if I try the first method and find that they are not using only the box on the first day, I go for the litter box only for a week method. The wood block works well if you are moving from a hutch outdoors to a litter box indoors. If you have an indoor cage, you can use the cage itself as the litter box (or attach a litter box to the section of the cage the rabbit has used for waste.) Be sure to use clay or newsprint litter as the other types arent necessarily good for rabbits. Wood litter is okay if you are sure it isnt fir. The most important thing is to clean anywhere they have an accident.

So, dont place the aquarium at a worse location than before ((more) direct impact of sunlight which might cause algae growning, less stable or unleveled surface, more noise emission for the room it will stands in). Remove heavy pieces of decoration and all electronical equipment. Only very small aquariums (≤ 60 l) might be carried when almost empty. Carefully evaluate the stress for the inhabitants being contained in an almost empty aquarium for short time and being moved to a temporary location and back. If you have an unused running aquarium at hand, consider using it for some time and moving fish back after days or weeks only to reduce the frequency of moves. Carry with two persons and lift and base very symetrically in order to minimize the tension on the glass and joints - its not a piece of furniture. If fish are in the aquarium while carrying, add a cover to prevent them from jumping out. When moving over a long distance, more things have to be considered and organized; theyre not covered by the above listing.\n","\t [2] \t\t 18.1 \t\t I would wait at least a week or two after moving an established tank to add new fish, and ideally closer to a month. Moving the tank does a few things to disturb its normal equilibrium, so its just safer to wait until things have settled back down. Its really important to monitor your water quality after the move. For one, in a lot of cases youre doing a huge water change -- probably 75% or more with a larger tank. If the pH, temperature, or hardness of the new water is dramatically different, this not only directly affects your fish, but your biofilter as well. You also kick up a lot of detritus from the substrate. All this rotting food, fish waste, bacteria, etc. can easily impact your water chemistry -- its potentially a lot more than the biofilter can handle right away. And the mechanical filter will have to deal with an above-average amount of, shall we say, fine particulate organic matter. Also bear in mind that the existing fish have just gone through a highly stressful event. Even if the water chemistry is 100% perfect after the move, theyre going to be more prone to health problems for a little bit. The immune system of a healthy fish will normally prevent the latent diseases in an aquarium from actually causing any sickness, but this level of stress can interfere with that. You dont necessarily need to treat the fish as if theyre in quarantine after a tank move, but its good to just watch them carefully over the next few weeks just in case. And any new fish is a potential source of new diseases as well -- its safer to wait until your fish have settled in, rather than adding this at a point where theyre more susceptible than usual. This is sort of unrelated to the new-fish part of your question, but be extremely careful when you move a tank to get as much water as possible out of it. Water is shockingly heavy (when full, your tank weighs more than a grown man), and though the silicone holding a tank together is extremely strong, the shifting weight of water as it sloshes around can put mechanical stresses on side seams that arent meant to be load bearing. If its at all possible, try to take all the water, substrate, and decorations out of a tank when moving it, to prevent damage.\n","\t [3] \t\t 17.2 \t\t Ive personally had this problem with my turtle when I moved him to a tank during a storm, hes been outside alone in his outdoor enclosure with no reflection so he didnt react the best he could to his reflection. He wasnt particularly aggressive, but he did occasionally run into the glass and it probably was stressing him out. The first thing you do is give him time, sometimes all it takes is a few days. If this problem persists then you have a few options which are rather partial solutions. First of all, make sure the room he is in is well lit, and his enclosure isnt too bright. This is somewhat hard because he does require basking lights, so what you can do is somewhat surround his basking area with plants or logs that will hinder the light from hitting the glass and cause a reflection. Keeping the glass terrarium near a bright wall will also help. If all this doesnt work, add some ornament bulk around the edges, in a way you can still see him of course. And finally you can go for covering 1-3 of the sides with the paper made for aquariums. As far as I know these are mainly the ways you can minimize his reflection. You may have to take all measures to make him settle, but hopefully you wont. I could see how such a situation could be stressful as whenever he tries to exert dominance the other dragon will be equally dominant, and if he backs off, the other will too, which will entice him to exert dominance again, and so on. Fortunately, reptiles, though thought of as unintelligent, are great learners and can recognise a pattern and act accordingly, so theres hope hell simply settle with time.\n","\t [4] \t\t 16.8 \t\t Aquarium backgrounds are a good idea for more than one reason. One idea behind putting a background in, is to make the fish feel like they are in a more natural environment. They can feel more hidden than being in the front of the tank where it is brighter (less light exposure= more well hidden = less stress). Also its used as general decor... A background can be prettier than a wall, or the other side of this room you speak of. Fish like to have a place to hide and if you have enough decor and plants (artificial or live), and maybe some that float on the surface as well, you can achieve this for them without background. Background will also keep from additional natural light from hitting all sides of the tank. The less natural light you have on your aquarium = less algae growth = more oxygen in your tank = healthier environment/less stress on your fish. Side note: when you bring fish home in a clear bag its typically recommended to put that bag into a paper or colored bag or bucket to reduce stress during transport. This is the same concept.\n","\t [5] \t\t 16.2 \t\t In general, moving a pregnant platy is a bad idea. You want to have the female in an aquarium where you want the fry to be born, then remove the mother after she gives birth to prevent her eating her young. I keep a large ball of java moss in with my platy-mommy which seems to give the fry plenty of hiding places. Moving a pregnant platy, even to a divider, is likely to increase the stress on the fish and increase the likelihood that she terminates in order to protect herself. You can place a male in the females tank for breeding, but remember that platys can give birth to multiple fry with only one fertilization) If you dont have a separate aquarium for your platy-mommy, consider adding a ball of java moss or plenty of other hiding places somehow. I have never had a tank divider work and my fish always seem stressed inside them.

Theyre just like your children, you can expect things to come up and you need to be able to care for them.\n","\t [2] \t\t 18.7 \t\t I breed mastiffs so I will try to help you with this: Age Amount 4-8 weeks 3-4 cups per day spread between 3-4 meals 8-12 weeks 4-6 cups per day spread between 3-4 meals 12-16 weeks 6-8 cups per day spread between 3-4 meals 4 to 6 months 8-10 cups per day spread between 2-3 meals 6-18 months 8-12 cups per day spread between 2-3 meals These measurements are in another web site but I have been following this rule for years now. OK my point is, as a breeder if you have not even got the puppy yet and you are already saying that you cannot afford to spend too much in dog food do yourself a favor and dont get the dog. Why? English mastiffs need high quality food; their growth and life quality depends on it. Lets say you buy cheap dog food filled with byproduct stuff; now that dog is going to grow so fast and fat that, trust me, you are going to have an unhealthy dog for life. You already damaged the dogs joints etc. Now we are not talking about $5 or $15 dollars more on food. Now its about thousands of dollars on surgeries, therapies, and a life full of pain for your dog, you see is like a chain reaction. This is a good example: Blue Buffalo the biggest bag they sell is 30 pounds for $55 plus tax, so about $60. Each of my English mastiffs eat that in a 2 week period, so each mastiff will cost you just on food $120 a month. Now throw the vet bills etc. I am not saying that you have to feed them Blue Buffalo; there are other good quality dog foods out there, but this is the one I use and the one I recommend as the owner of 6 baby giants. I hope this has helped.\n","\t [3] \t\t 15.5 \t\t Huskies were bred to survive on little food and water. As puppies they eat 3 times a day and wean themselves to twice a day. As adults they mostly eat once a day but will often skip meals. They only eat when they’re hungry which is not often at all. I used to work in a daycare and experienced this finicky behavior often. I currently have a 1 year old husky who eats 2 cups maybe every other day. I offer at the same time everyday and let her decide if she wants to eat or not. If she doesn’t I simply put the food away and offer it the next day.\n","LLM 대답>>:\n","정보가 부족해서 답을 할 수 없습니다.\n"]}],"source":["\n","messages = [\n","{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"안녕하세요, 저는 새로운 개 주인이고 방금 영국 마스티프를 입양했어요. 그를 돌보는 데 대해 몇 가지 팁을 줄 수 있나요?\"},\n","{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"물론이죠! 영국 마스티프 같은 대형견을 돌보는 것은 매우 보람찬 일입니다. 그들은 균형 잡힌 식단, 규칙적인 운동, 그리고 정기적인 수의사 검진이 필요합니다. 그들의 돌봄에 대해 구체적으로 궁금한 점이 있나요?\"},\n","{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"네, 특히 그의 식단에 대해 걱정이 되네요. 1살 영국 마스티프에게 얼마나 많은 양을 먹여야 하나요?\"},\n","]\n","\n","conversation_search(messages, persona_function_calling, tools)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":92,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7536,"status":"ok","timestamp":1706099687447,"user":{"displayName":"Jaekyoung(배재경)","userId":"15272867038869688191"},"user_tz":-540},"id":"WEDIbcJ-beJt","outputId":"045113a1-8643-4306-a93b-5b42409a15ec"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["검색어>>:  Are deaf cats more aggressive than other cats?\n","\n","검색결과>>: \n","\t [1] \t\t 26.2 \t\t We had a deaf cat, sadly passed away only about a month ago, and to be honest we didnt handle her any differently than our other cat. The things to bear in mind are: Theyre easier to surprise and every cat might react a little differently if startled, particularly from sleep. Ours just kind of jumped up, but others might be a bit more aggressive. They wont react to shouts or loud noises. We used to clap our hands to get the attention of our cats when they were doing things like clawing furniture. That would usually get them to stop, but that was totally useless with her once she went deaf. At that point wed just pick her up and remove her from the area, which seemed to work. Deaf cats still like attention, grooming, and petting. I found that she became even more of a lap cat once she became deaf, possibly because of getting touch feedback from us. In any event, cats are pretty adaptable and deafness will probably be a minor impediment to them and you. I wouldnt be worried about it, barely something we noticed.\n","\t [2] \t\t 20.9 \t\t As everyone points out, no difference really. To call attention you will have to change sound waves to another type (both clapping and stomping) and cause air pressure waves to which cats have relative sensitivity (stomps in my opinion are better). One precaution though, do not let the cat to go outside unattended, as he is far more likely to fall prey to accidents of all sort. Another case is panic; if something startles your cat really badly, he will panic with more lasting effect as hearing cannot tell him if he is being chased etc. so a little sensitivity on the subject is required As John Cavan wrote, deaf cat will be far more likely to be couch cat, as he will be loving sensory input from petting to replace missing sensory input from hearing.\n","\t [3] \t\t 20.2 \t\t We had a cat that was congenitally deaf. She was an indoor cat only. The major difference was that to call her, we would stomp on the floor. Other than that, she was a really active, curious, playful, normal kitty.

We set up a line - about 3 catchers, the vet with syringes/bottles, the castrating board, and the ringer. A catcher would grab a pig, go thru a gate, get in line & hold the pig while the vet gave the shots. He then moved to the castrate line and held the pig during castration. And then moved to the ringer line - and then put the pig thru a pasture gate. As for cruelty, Im guessing that the ringing was the least cruel of the 3 processes. Hard to tell, pigs scream continuously the entire time that you handle them (be sure to wear ear protection). And wear leather gloves, they reach around and bite your thumb at every opportunity. If you grow pastured hogs, youll need rings, 250 pound hogs can dig under most fences, actually pull posts out of ground, wreck the side of wooden buildings, etc. If you are raising hogs on concrete confinement, they hurt each other - when they fight, they bite each other, the rings make that uncomfortable for them.\n","\t [2] \t\t 14.0 \t\t It may be illegal, yes - but it was a generous act. And yes, some do carry Salmonella and have respiratory problems. The tortoise should not eat lettuce, coleslaw, or anything along that line. First, put him in a shallow container of lukewarm water to make sure he is clean and expels the waste. Tortoises urinate and defecate in water, so you will need to let him do his thing, then give him a clean container about once or twice a week to go in on his own. Also, provide a separate container to leave in for it to drink out of. They eat (all shredded) fresh kale, shredded carrots, collard, turnip and mustard greens, green beans, sweet potatoes snow peas, some types of fruits. They also have tortoise food in a pet or feed store, but I would recommend making your own salad of the above. You can make most of it in advance and if you have access to fresh clean grass or alfalfa grass or pellets. They also eat some dead plants and weeds, just double check to make sure they are not poisonous. They also need sunlight or an UVB florescent light if they cannot get the real thing. They also have vitamins that will help greatly. Good luck and when in doubt, ask Google or go to a tortoise site for help. I had been raising a desert tortoise for 5 years (15 years ago) that was a hatchling and covered in red ants when my husband found her. But when she had to go to a forever home (landlord issues), she was given a perfect health checkup from the new moms vet. I still miss her but know she is with other tortoises and should be having good her own babies by now. The tortoise will eat when she is settle in her new home and after she goes to the bathroom. They only eat maybe once a day really good. Some only once a week. This is the time they are coming out of hibernation and she may have already eaten. Best to not handle her and let her be to get settled in a while. Just keep feeding and giving her fresh water on a daily basis. Again, good luck.\n","\t [3] \t\t 13.8 \t\t It is extremely ill advised to try to hand raise a newborn kitten. It should only be done if for some reason the mother is unable or unwilling to properly care for it, so that your options are either care for it yourself, or let the kitten be neglected. I would even say it is cruel in that caring for a newborn kitten is very difficult, and if you fail to do it completely right, the kitten could become ill, malnourished, or even die, and even if you do manage to do everything exactly right, you have taken an unnecessary risk to the kittens health, rather than acting in its best interest by leaving it with its mother until a suitable age to be separated. For one, mothers milk will always be best for the kitten. Mammals pass on antibodies through their milk, and they have evolved to produce the most optimal milk for their young. Any substitute just wont be as good. You should only use formula designed to be fed to kittens, as you cannot be sure that they will not become malnourished if you feed them some other substitute. And even then, the kitten will probably be more susceptible to disease, as it will miss out on important antibodies it would have received from its mothers milk. For another thing, newborn kittens need around-the-clock constant care. Like with newborn babies, they must be fed every few hours without fail, even thoughout the night, and their milk must be carefully prepared, all bottles carefully sterilized. They also must be stimulated to eliminate after every feeding. The constant chores of cleaning and disinfecting all equipment you use, plus any time spent actively caring for them will mean you will have very little time to do anything else until they are weaned. So please, do not separate any kittens from their mom until at the minimum they are weaned, which is around 8 or 10 weeks. Some experts recommend waiting even longer, until they have had to get more socialized.\n","LLM 대답>>:\n","정말 죄송합니다만, 주어진 정보로는 낙타를 키우는 데 필요한 준비에 대해 도움을 드릴 수 없습니다.\n"]}],"source":["\n","messages = [\n","{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"낙타를 키우고 싶은데 어떤 준비가 필요한가요?\"}\n","]\n","\n","conversation_search(messages, persona_function_calling, tools)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":94,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2746,"status":"ok","timestamp":1706099782745,"user":{"displayName":"Jaekyoung(배재경)","userId":"15272867038869688191"},"user_tz":-540},"id":"S-37JZMAJSK7","outputId":"e99ce57d-1b5f-4674-b4b5-80d8fe718c26"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["LLM 대답>>:\n","제가 여기 있어요! 반려 동물 전문가로 여러분이 고양이를 입양하는 데 도움을 드릴 수 있어요. 무엇이든 물어보세요!\n"]}],"source":["# 지식에 대한 질문이 아닌 경우\n","\n","messages = [\n","{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"저는 고양이를 입양하고 싶은데, 최근에 청각장애가 있는 고양이를 만났어요. 조금 걱정이 되네요. 특별히 고려해야 할 점이 있나요?\"},\n","{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"청각장애가 있는 고양이를 입양하는 것은 독특하고 보람찬 경험이 될 수 있습니다. 이들은 일반적으로 안전한 실내 환경과 명확한 시각적 의사소통이 필요합니다. 특별히 걱정되는 점이 있나요?\"},\n","{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"그런데 너는 누구니?\"}\n","]\n","\n","#conversation_search(messages, persona_function_calling, tools, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"searcher\"}})\n","conversation_search(messages, persona_function_calling, tools)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ocgzw_rKxKAn"},"source":["#Reference"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4by_4X6tvaX6"},"source":["## Required Package\n","\n","openai==1.7.2 <br>\n","colbert-ir==0.2.14 <br>\n","torch==1.13.1 <br>\n","faiss-gpu==1.7.0\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"gpuType":"T4","provenance":[],"toc_visible":true},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
