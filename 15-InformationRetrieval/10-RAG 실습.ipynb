They like to pee and poop in the same place every time, so in most cases all you have to do is put a little bit of their waste in the litter box and they will happily use the litter box. It is very important that if they go somewhere else, miss the edge or kick waste out of the box that you clean it up well and immediately as otherwise those spots will become existing places to pee and poop. When you clean the box, save a little bit of waste and put it in the cleaned box so it smells right to them. For a more foolproof method, you can get a piece of wood soaked with their urine and put that in the box along with droppings or cage them so that they are only in their litter box for a week. Generally, if I try the first method and find that they are not using only the box on the first day, I go for the litter box only for a week method. The wood block works well if you are moving from a hutch outdoors to a litter box indoors. If you have an indoor cage, you can use the cage itself as the litter box (or attach a litter box to the section of the cage the rabbit has used for waste.) Be sure to use clay or newsprint litter as the other types arent necessarily good for rabbits. Wood litter is okay if you are sure it isnt fir. The most important thing is to clean anywhere they have an accident. High sided boxes help with avoiding kicking soiled litter out of the box, which is the biggest cause of failure in my experience.\n"]}],"source":["from datasets import load_dataset\n","\n","# LoTTE dataset 사용\n","\n","dataset = 'lifestyle'\n","datasplit = 'dev'\n","\n","collection_dataset = load_dataset(\"colbertv2/lotte_passages\", dataset)\n","collection = [x['text'] for x in collection_dataset[datasplit + '_collection']]\n","\n","queries_dataset = load_dataset(\"colbertv2/lotte\", dataset)\n","queries = [x['query'] for x in queries_dataset['search_' + datasplit]]\n","\n","print(f'Loaded {len(queries)} queries and {len(collection):,} passages')\n","print(queries[0])\n","print(collection[0])"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"e6hHzHjno7ZZ"},"source":["## 1.

They like to pee and poop in the same place every time, so in most cases all you have to do is put a little bit of their waste in the litter box and they will happily use the litter box. It is very important that if they go somewhere else, miss the edge or kick waste out of the box that you clean it up well and immediately as otherwise those spots will become existing places to pee and poop. When you clean the box, save a little bit of waste and put it in the cleaned box so it smells right to them. For a more foolproof method, you can get a piece of wood soaked with their urine and put that in the box along with droppings or cage them so that they are only in their litter box for a week. Generally, if I try the first method and find that they are not using only the box on the first day, I go for the litter box only for a week method. The wood block works well if you are moving from a hutch outdoors to a litter box indoors. If you have an indoor cage, you can use the cage itself as the litter box (or attach a litter box to the section of the cage the rabbit has used for waste.) Be sure to use clay or newsprint litter as the other types arent necessarily good for rabbits. Wood litter is okay if you are sure it isnt fir. The most important thing is to clean anywhere they have an accident. High sided boxes help with avoiding kicking soiled litter out of the box, which is the biggest cause of failure in my experience.\",\n","            \"...rabbits can be easily trained to use a litter tray, sometimes with more reliability than your average cat! The natural instinct of a wild rabbit to use one area as its latrine is still apparent in its domestic counterparts. (1) The actual process is very similar to pad training a dog or litter box training a cat. Keep the rabbit confined to a small area while training, move any accidents to the litter box, and the rabbit will naturally start using that area for its business. The source link has the details. (1) Litter Training Your Rabbit Emma Magnus MSc Association of Pet Behaviour Counsellors apbc.org.uk\",\n","            \"It could be a multitude of things. Lack of exercise plays a big role in how your dog acts. If they have a lot of unused energy, theyre more likely to act up. Giving him treats or praise will encourage the behavior youre trying to prevent. You want to refrain from treats or praise until hes doing what you want him to do. In the mean time, make it clear to him what you want. You want to be the focus of his attention when you come across a child or another dog. You can do this by keeping him right next to you (never in front of you) by using a short leash. If he tries to pull, tilt the leash upwards. Doing so creates unusual pressure on the bottom of his neck, causing him to look up and see whats going on. If he still wont turn his attention to you, you can forcefully nudge him with the side of your leg until he yields. Ive found with my dog sometimes I have to step in front of her and hold her muzzle, forcing her to look at me. Its also important that you remain calm. Its easy to get upset and dogs have the ability of reading our emotions. If youre tense and angry, hell start tune you out.

So, dont place the aquarium at a worse location than before ((more) direct impact of sunlight which might cause algae growning, less stable or unleveled surface, more noise emission for the room it will stands in). Remove heavy pieces of decoration and all electronical equipment. Only very small aquariums (≤ 60 l) might be carried when almost empty. Carefully evaluate the stress for the inhabitants being contained in an almost empty aquarium for short time and being moved to a temporary location and back. If you have an unused running aquarium at hand, consider using it for some time and moving fish back after days or weeks only to reduce the frequency of moves. Carry with two persons and lift and base very symetrically in order to minimize the tension on the glass and joints - its not a piece of furniture. If fish are in the aquarium while carrying, add a cover to prevent them from jumping out. When moving over a long distance, more things have to be considered and organized; theyre not covered by the above listing.\n","\t [2] \t\t 17.9 \t\t I would wait at least a week or two after moving an established tank to add new fish, and ideally closer to a month. Moving the tank does a few things to disturb its normal equilibrium, so its just safer to wait until things have settled back down. Its really important to monitor your water quality after the move. For one, in a lot of cases youre doing a huge water change -- probably 75% or more with a larger tank. If the pH, temperature, or hardness of the new water is dramatically different, this not only directly affects your fish, but your biofilter as well. You also kick up a lot of detritus from the substrate. All this rotting food, fish waste, bacteria, etc. can easily impact your water chemistry -- its potentially a lot more than the biofilter can handle right away. And the mechanical filter will have to deal with an above-average amount of, shall we say, fine particulate organic matter. Also bear in mind that the existing fish have just gone through a highly stressful event. Even if the water chemistry is 100% perfect after the move, theyre going to be more prone to health problems for a little bit. The immune system of a healthy fish will normally prevent the latent diseases in an aquarium from actually causing any sickness, but this level of stress can interfere with that. You dont necessarily need to treat the fish as if theyre in quarantine after a tank move, but its good to just watch them carefully over the next few weeks just in case. And any new fish is a potential source of new diseases as well -- its safer to wait until your fish have settled in, rather than adding this at a point where theyre more susceptible than usual. This is sort of unrelated to the new-fish part of your question, but be extremely careful when you move a tank to get as much water as possible out of it. Water is shockingly heavy (when full, your tank weighs more than a grown man), and though the silicone holding a tank together is extremely strong, the shifting weight of water as it sloshes around can put mechanical stresses on side seams that arent meant to be load bearing. If its at all possible, try to take all the water, substrate, and decorations out of a tank when moving it, to prevent damage.\n","\t [3] \t\t 16.2 \t\t In general, moving a pregnant platy is a bad idea. You want to have the female in an aquarium where you want the fry to be born, then remove the mother after she gives birth to prevent her eating her young. I keep a large ball of java moss in with my platy-mommy which seems to give the fry plenty of hiding places. Moving a pregnant platy, even to a divider, is likely to increase the stress on the fish and increase the likelihood that she terminates in order to protect herself. You can place a male in the females tank for breeding, but remember that platys can give birth to multiple fry with only one fertilization) If you dont have a separate aquarium for your platy-mommy, consider adding a ball of java moss or plenty of other hiding places somehow. I have never had a tank divider work and my fish always seem stressed inside them. Hope this helps.\n","\t [4] \t\t 16.0 \t\t Good on you for moving them to a new tank. That should give them more room. I did a similar move quite early in my fishkeeping days, and the following is a combination of what I did and things I would do differently now I have more knowledge. You have exactly the right idea in keeping the water and components the same. That should minimise the impact of the change. Keeping the same water should minimise the stress to the fish and keeping the same filter should keep the bacterial consistency of the filter medium the same. The biggest problem I see with your plan is the substrate: theres usually a lot of decomposing matter on the tank floor, and it might introduce more problems than it would solve to try to migrate the gravel without the decomposing matter. As soon as you start to try and shovel it up, all that decomposing matter will start floating around in the water. If it were me, Id probably use the opportunity to buy new gravel. Rinse it thoroughly before adding it to the new tank to remove dust, soak it for 24 hours in dechlorinated water (or tank water if you have any to spare), discard the soaking water and then add the gravel to the new tank. In the old tank, suck the water up until about an inch off the floor (point the tube at the edge rather than the bottom of the tank, to avoid sucking up the decomposing matter) to go into the new tank, then ditch the last inchs worth of water and the old gravel. Alternatively, to keep the gravel, Id say suck the water up as above, leaving the gravel undisturbed for as long as possible, then take the gravel out, put it in the sink and rinse it thoroughly to get rid of all the debris and dirt. Ideally youd rinse it with tank water, but itll probably need quite a bit of a rinse, and the water you use to rinse wont be useable for the new tank since it will be full of decomposing matter. On balance I think its better to rinse with tap water and have more water to put in the new tank. Then add it to the new tank and continue from there. This might be a better option than replacing the gravel entirely, since youll lose the decomposing matter but still have any algae etc. that are on the old gravel, and dont risk altering the pH or introducing new solutes into the water with the new gravel. Youve got the right idea with the water changes as well. Too much of a change will stress the fish, and fresh water from the tap is completely different from water theyve been living in for a while. Starting off with the minimum you need to allow the filter to work is a good idea - theyre going to be stressed enough from the move anyway without a huge water change. Id leave it at least a week before adding more, but also test the nitrate/nitrite and pH before and after moving, to see if anythings changed. As long as the tests are okay, Id consider adding 20% more at a time, as if its just a normal water change. So after the move youll have 11.5 gallons. You could add 2.3 gallons in the first water addition, then 2.8, then 3.4, which would take you up to 20 gallons. If you want to stay on the safe side, you could reduce those a bit so it would take you one more change to get up to 20. Of course, if you get an ammonia or nitrite spike, youll probably want to change some water as well as adding some. So you could take out 10% and put in 20%. Youll get to 20 gallons more slowly that way but it will enable you to remove some water as well as just adding. Finally, Id recommend leaving the filter cartridge in there for a bit longer so as not to disrupt the filtration system (in terms of bacteria and so on) too much. Alternatively, or additionally, rinse it at your next change instead of discarding it entirely. When I kept fish I had a filter which had two spaces to put the medium, which allowed me to change only half at a time, which was great for keeping the bacteria consistent. Im not sure from your description that you have one like that but rinsing it would have a less dramatic effect than binning it and starting afresh.\n","\t [5] \t\t 15.8 \t\t Consistency is key Moving fish/Amphibians is always going to be stressful for them. The best thing you can do to ensure that they are stressed as little as possible is to keep the conditions as similar as you can during the transport and beyond. Your key question is about the process of re-cycling the existing tank after the move. This shouldnt be necessary assuming that you take the necessary steps to ensure that your filter media (really the beneficial bacteria that lives on it) is not adversely affected. To my knowledge there are not a lot of things that differ between moving an Axolotl and a fish so let’s take a look at the process that I would and have followed in the past: Do your homework Plan your journey from the old location to the new one (avoid a road where your fish are going to be bounced around that doesnt gain you significant time). Are you likely to get stuck in traffic? (You said it’s an hour long journey, could that easily become 2?) Is there a good time of day to do this at (early morning/ late evening when traffic is minimal for example) Is it easy to get the tank in and setup ready for the axolotl or will it take some time? Are you going to need help moving the tank? Rope in some others to help you out. Is the temperature going to be drastically different to the regular water temperature? Cars can get warm in the sun, try to keep temperature fluctuations to a minimum. This might sound a bit overkill but if your journey could suddenly double in length, the last thing you want is your pet paying the price for it. The Move As ever, the smoother you can make this transition, the better for the Axolotl. Be very careful when moving a tank which has water in [1]. As you say, you’ll want the absolute minumum water in it as possible because without the stand bracing the tank in the correct place you may find that it cracks. In the case of an external sump filter [2], you may be able to completely drain the tank and just keep the sump filled with water instead. Either way, keep the filter full submerged or your bacteria may die off. If you have tropical or marine fish, you would need to be more aware of the temperature because it’s harder to keep water at greater odds to the environment at the same temperature (see Newton’s Law of Cooling for more information). You’ll want to move as much of the aquarium water as you can to the new tank location for two reasons; firstly, if the animal is already acclimatised with this water, that will be one less ‘new’ aspect for it to get used to and secondly; if you move water that you already know is of ‘good quality’, it reduces the number of variables if problems arise later on. Check the parameters of the water at the new location to ensure that they are not drastically different to what the Axolotl is used to. If the water parameters change quickly in the new location this could cause health complications. You could also place the axolotl in one of the containers because the more water you transport your axolotl in, the less impact the waste it produces will have on the quality of the water and the slower the water temperature will change in relation to its surround environment [3]. If you can use an opaque container then that’s even better because most aquarium animals will simply go to sleep as if it were night time (excluding nocturnal fish). It all boils down to: “As quickly and safely as you can make it. Settling in It goes without saying that once the move is complete, you’ll need to keep a careful eye on the parameters of your tank and if there is any spike in Ammonia or Nitirite, you’ll need to deal with it fast or the Axolotl will suffer. As I said above, check that the water in the new location is similar to the old. If it isn’t, gradually transition to the new water but allow time for the inhabitants to get used to it. Summary I know I keep repeating this, but ‘easy does it’. The Axolotl will be much happier if you ensure there is as little change over the journey to it’s new home as possible. Of course you can just put it in a box and take your chances, but stress is one of the biggest killers in aquarium fish and whilst they might not die because of the journey, it could see a decreased lifespan. The steps suggested above are ones I followed when moving my Tropical Community tank from one flat to another (30 minutes away, 2 flights of stairs) and I was very glad I’d planned it in advance to avoid making what can be a difficult task into a nightmare for the fish and I. 1: Can I Move a Partially Filled Aquarium? - The spruce 2: What is an external sump filter? - OscarFishLover.com 3: How does cooling scale with volume? - physics.stackexchange.com\n"]}],"source":["# 문서 검색 - 영어 문서이기 때문에 영어로 질의 생성\n","queries = [\"What are key factors to consider for minimizing stress when moving an aquarium?\"]\n","\n","for query in queries:\n","  print(f\"#> {query}\")\n","\n","  # Find the top-5 passages for this query\n","  results = searcher.search(query, k=5)\n","\n","  # Print out the top-k retrieved passages\n","  for passage_id, passage_rank, passage_score in zip(*results):\n","      print(f\"\\t [{passage_rank}] \\t\\t {passage_score:.1f} \\t\\t {searcher.collection[passage_id]}\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MS57uiKoFVll"},"source":["## 3. 대화형 IR\n","\n","준비된 검색엔진과 LLM을 활용하셔 대화형 IR 시스템 구현"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["# OpenAI 라이브러리 및 필요한 모듈을 가져옵니다.\n","import os\n","import json\n","from openai import OpenAI\n","\n","# OpenAI API 키를 환경변수에서 설정합니다.\n","os.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = API_KEY\n","\n","client = OpenAI()\n","# 사용할 모델을 설정합니다. 여기서는 gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 모델을 사용합니다.\n","#llm_model = \"gpt-4-1106-preview\"\n","llm_model = \"gpt-4o\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":26,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":447,"status":"ok","timestamp":1706099315859,"user":{"displayName":"Jaekyoung(배재경)","userId":"15272867038869688191"},"user_tz":-540},"id":"5N5-TS64FYrB"},"outputs":[],"source":["\n","persona_qa = \"\"\"\n","## Role: 반려 동물 전문가\n","\n","## Instructions\n","- 사용자의 이전 메시지 정보 및 주어진 Reference(JSON 형태로 제공) 정보를 활용하여 간결하게 답변을 생성한다.\n","- 주어진 검색 결과 정보로 대답할 수 없는 경우는 다른 대답 하지 말고 \"정보가 부족해서 답을 할 수 없습니다\"라고 대답한다.\n","- 한국어로 답변을 생성한다.\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","persona_function_calling = \"\"\"\n","## Role: 반려 동물 전문가\n","\n","## Instruction\n","- 사용자가 대화를 통해 반려 동물 관련된 지식이나 도움을 요청하면 search api를 호출할 수 있어야 한다.\n","- Search api에 필요한 standalone_query는 영어로 생성한다.\n","- 반려 동물과 관련되지 않은 나머지 대화 메시지에는 적절한 대답을 생성한다.\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","tools = [\n","    {\n","        \"type\": \"function\",\n","        \"function\": {\n","            \"name\": \"search\",\n","            \"description\": \"search knowledge from the user messages sent and received.\",\n","            \"parameters\": {\n","                \"properties\": {\n","                    \"standalone_query\": {\n","                        \"type\": \"string\",\n","                        \"description\": \"English query suitable for use in search from the user messages history.\"\n","                    }\n","                },\n","                \"required\": [\"standalone_query\"],\n","                \"type\": \"object\"\n","            }\n","        }\n","    },\n","]\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":27,"metadata":{"executionInfo":{"elapsed":339,"status":"ok","timestamp":1706099542898,"user":{"displayName":"Jaekyoung(배재경)","userId":"15272867038869688191"},"user_tz":-540},"id":"LQWIW8PMHUVv"},"outputs":[],"source":["# 대화형 Agent를 위한 dialog manager 구현\n","\n","import json\n","\n","def conversation_search(messages, persona, tools):\n","    msg = [{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": persona}] + messages\n","\n","    ##

I have been feeding him Blue Buffalo since I got him at 8 weeks old. He is very lean and active for a bull mastiff. I feed him about 3-4 cups twice a day which averages about 130.00 a month. It is very important that you can afford this breed. I just had to take mine to the vet because he developed some sort of allergies on his skin, eyes and ears and the vet bill was $210.00 with all his medication. This wasnt an option I had to take him an get all his meds or he would have gotten worse. Theyre just like your children, you can expect things to come up and you need to be able to care for them.\n","\t [2] \t\t 19.1 \t\t I breed mastiffs so I will try to help you with this: Age Amount 4-8 weeks 3-4 cups per day spread between 3-4 meals 8-12 weeks 4-6 cups per day spread between 3-4 meals 12-16 weeks 6-8 cups per day spread between 3-4 meals 4 to 6 months 8-10 cups per day spread between 2-3 meals 6-18 months 8-12 cups per day spread between 2-3 meals These measurements are in another web site but I have been following this rule for years now. OK my point is, as a breeder if you have not even got the puppy yet and you are already saying that you cannot afford to spend too much in dog food do yourself a favor and dont get the dog. Why? English mastiffs need high quality food; their growth and life quality depends on it. Lets say you buy cheap dog food filled with byproduct stuff; now that dog is going to grow so fast and fat that, trust me, you are going to have an unhealthy dog for life. You already damaged the dogs joints etc. Now we are not talking about $5 or $15 dollars more on food. Now its about thousands of dollars on surgeries, therapies, and a life full of pain for your dog, you see is like a chain reaction. This is a good example: Blue Buffalo the biggest bag they sell is 30 pounds for $55 plus tax, so about $60. Each of my English mastiffs eat that in a 2 week period, so each mastiff will cost you just on food $120 a month. Now throw the vet bills etc. I am not saying that you have to feed them Blue Buffalo; there are other good quality dog foods out there, but this is the one I use and the one I recommend as the owner of 6 baby giants. I hope this has helped.\n","\t [3] \t\t 16.8 \t\t Based on this dog food calculator. A full grown mastiff will grow to be about 150-200 pounds1. Which means a 180 pound mastiff2 with what the site considers a typical activity level, and food with a kcal amount of 320 per cup3. Youre looking at roughly 10-11 cups of food twice a day. Alternatively, that would be about 2 pounds of food each meal. Multiply 4 pounds of food with 7 days in a week and that means youre looking at 28 pounds of food each week. Now thats a pretty rough estimate since you dont have the dog (or at least not yet), but you can play around with the calculator to figure out if those numbers are anything that you think you should be worried about. Note that if your dog happens to be larger, or even just more active, than the average it could very well need more food. And, depending on the type of food you purchase, it might need to eat more in order to receive the calories it needs in a day. The quality of food makes a difference, and the prices of food is related to the quality. In my opinion, if you have any concerns about being able to afford a 30 pound bag of dog food each week, then you should avoid large breed dogs. Keep in mind that you should be prepared to be able to afford to take your pet to a veterinarian if need be. That is an expense on top of the others. You should never have to skip feeding your pet in order to afford a vet bill. Also, if it turns out its allergic to certain ingredients you should be prepared to buy more expensive brands of food that exclude those ingredients. 1 http://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/mastiff 2 My estimated average weight based on the breeds weight range. 3 Based on the contents of Purina One healthy weight adult dog food.\n","LLM 대답>>:\n","1살 영국 마스티프에게는 하루에 약 8-12컵의 고품질 사료를 2-3끼로 나누어 급여하는 것이 좋습니다. 이는 그들의 성장과 건강을 위해 매우 중요합니다. 또한, 특정 사료 브랜드나 종류에 따라 필요한 양이 다를 수 있으므로, 사료 포장에 기재된 급여 지침을 참고하는 것도 좋습니다. \n","\n","추가로, 영국 마스티프는 알레르기나 건강 문제를 겪을 수 있으므로 정기적인 수의사 검진과 고품질 사료 선택이 중요합니다.\n"]}],"source":["\n","messages = [\n","{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"안녕하세요, 저는 새로운 개 주인이고 방금 영국 마스티프를 입양했어요. 그를 돌보는 데 대해 몇 가지 팁을 줄 수 있나요?\"},\n","{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"물론이죠! 영국 마스티프 같은 대형견을 돌보는 것은 매우 보람찬 일입니다. 그들은 균형 잡힌 식단, 규칙적인 운동, 그리고 정기적인 수의사 검진이 필요합니다. 그들의 돌봄에 대해 구체적으로 궁금한 점이 있나요?\"},\n","{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"네, 특히 그의 식단에 대해 걱정이 되네요. 1살 영국 마스티프에게 얼마나 많은 양을 먹여야 하나요?\"},\n","]\n","\n","conversation_search(messages, persona_function_calling, tools)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":29,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":7536,"status":"ok","timestamp":1706099687447,"user":{"displayName":"Jaekyoung(배재경)","userId":"15272867038869688191"},"user_tz":-540},"id":"WEDIbcJ-beJt","outputId":"045113a1-8643-4306-a93b-5b42409a15ec"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["검색어>>:  Are deaf cats more aggressive than hearing cats?\n","\n","검색결과>>: \n","\t [1] \t\t 25.7 \t\t We had a deaf cat, sadly passed away only about a month ago, and to be honest we didnt handle her any differently than our other cat. The things to bear in mind are: Theyre easier to surprise and every cat might react a little differently if startled, particularly from sleep. Ours just kind of jumped up, but others might be a bit more aggressive. They wont react to shouts or loud noises. We used to clap our hands to get the attention of our cats when they were doing things like clawing furniture. That would usually get them to stop, but that was totally useless with her once she went deaf. At that point wed just pick her up and remove her from the area, which seemed to work. Deaf cats still like attention, grooming, and petting. I found that she became even more of a lap cat once she became deaf, possibly because of getting touch feedback from us. In any event, cats are pretty adaptable and deafness will probably be a minor impediment to them and you. I wouldnt be worried about it, barely something we noticed.\n","\t [2] \t\t 22.3 \t\t As everyone points out, no difference really. To call attention you will have to change sound waves to another type (both clapping and stomping) and cause air pressure waves to which cats have relative sensitivity (stomps in my opinion are better). One precaution though, do not let the cat to go outside unattended, as he is far more likely to fall prey to accidents of all sort. Another case is panic; if something startles your cat really badly, he will panic with more lasting effect as hearing cannot tell him if he is being chased etc. so a little sensitivity on the subject is required As John Cavan wrote, deaf cat will be far more likely to be couch cat, as he will be loving sensory input from petting to replace missing sensory input from hearing.\n","\t [3] \t\t 21.2 \t\t Some people might consider this a positive behavior! However, not all cats are vocal just as not all dogs bark much, each is a little unique. Having said that, your cat may be a little hard of hearing. One of our cats is deaf and she will vocalize when being bundled up for the vet, but is otherwise quite silent. The only thing is, she sometimes looks like she is meowing but no sound comes out...\n","LLM 대답>>:\n","청각장애가 있는 고양이는 일반적으로 다른 고양이들보다 더 공격적이지는 않습니다. 다만, 놀라거나 깜짝 놀랐을 때 반응이 다를 수 있습니다. 예를 들어, 갑작스럽게 놀라면 일부 고양이는 공격적으로 반응할 수 있습니다. 청각장애가 있는 고양이는 소리에 반응하지 않기 때문에 시각적 신호나 진동을 이용해 주의를 끌어야 합니다. 또한, 실외에서의 안전을 위해 항상 실내에서 지내도록 하는 것이 좋습니다. 청각장애가 있는 고양이도 여전히 많은 애정과 관심을 필요로 하며, 이들은 터치와 같은 감각적 피드백을 더 선호할 수 있습니다.\n"]}],"source":["\n","messages = [\n","{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"저는 고양이를 입양하고 싶은데, 최근에 청각장애가 있는 고양이를 만났어요. 조금 걱정이 되네요. 특별히 고려해야 할 점이 있나요?\"},\n","{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"청각장애가 있는 고양이를 입양하는 것은 독특하고 보람찬 경험이 될 수 있습니다. 이들은 일반적으로 안전한 실내 환경과 명확한 시각적 의사소통이 필요합니다. 특별히 걱정되는 점이 있나요?\"},\n","{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"네, 그들의 행동에 대해 궁금해요. 청각장애가 있는 고양이는 다른 고양이들보다 더 공격적인가요?\"}\n","]\n","\n","conversation_search(messages, persona_function_calling, tools)\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":30,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4747,"status":"ok","timestamp":1706099732287,"user":{"displayName":"Jaekyoung(배재경)","userId":"15272867038869688191"},"user_tz":-540},"id":"sWFV76KrO9ZV","outputId":"152070fe-04e3-4f6c-906e-b8cff09410c1"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["검색어>>:  What preparations are needed to keep a camel as a pet?\n","\n","검색결과>>: \n","\t [1] \t\t 14.8 \t\t Sugar gliders are very high maintenance pets. They require an enormous amount of attention and care, and they are very fickle little things. Do not get a single glider - they have a huge amount of trouble living alone. Get two or more, or dont get any. Your house will need to be thoroughly prepared for sugar gliders. They can fit in tiny spaces, climb on everything, and glide to the last places youd imagine. They chew wires, pee and poop everywhere, and knock stuff over left and right. Their diet requires live insects and grubs, and youll probably end up with a bunch of renegade cricket escapees living in your house. Their diet must be varied constantly, but any given glider will have its own tastes, and will reject foods it doesnt like. You need to have a constant supply of fruits, vegetables, and insects at all times, and youll probably have to hand feed the gliders a significant portion of the time. They are extremely grumpy during the daytime, and extremely active all night long. Expect to be the landing pad for endless glides. They will climb the highest object in the room, hop off, glide across the room, and land directly on top of you, while you are sleeping. Most owners will make a sort of nesting bag out of fleece, and keep the gliders inside it while they are sleeping. With a drawstring, you can wear the bag around your neck. This is adorable and sweet, but it will quickly drive home the fact that gliders are absolutely unbearable during the daytime. If you so much as move the wrong way, they will grumble and grouse about it for several minutes. If you try to wake them, they will make you pay the price. They hate being woken up or disturbed while they are trying to sleep. You need to find one of the very few veterinarians who actually know how to treat a sugar glider. Most vets have no idea how to handle tiny marsupials from Papua New Guinea. Expect to pay top dollar for medical care. You will also have to shell out the bucks for nutritional supplements, because gliders are so finicky and stubborn about their food. If and when a glider dies, you have to buy another one, because they die of loneliness. A solitary glider is a very unhappy glider, and will probably become a dead glider sooner than later. There are also moral and ethical concerns regarding the owning of sugar gliders. They are not a very common species, and it is likely that a large portion of the gliders that end up in a pet shop have been trapped in the wild and shipped overseas. By purchasing a glider, you are making yourself complicit in the depopulation of wild gliders. In short, you cant just ask people on this site what you need to consider before buying a glider. You need to buy some books on the subject and read them in their entirety. Bringing sugar gliders into your home is not a decision that should be taken lightly. You are considering making a decision that will require an enormous amount of time, money, effort, education, and lifestyle changes. An incredibly active nocturnal animal is a challenging pet to own, and gliders are even more demanding than most other animals.\n","\t [2] \t\t 14.6 \t\t The Humane Society of the United States has a few suggestions to prepare your pet. Some of them sound a little silly, but they do work. One of the most important things is getting the pet used to the new noises and sounds the baby will make - a lot of pets will find baby cries and the like upsetting. You can play crying sounds and the like to acclimate the pet, for example. As for actual introduction of the baby to the pet, they suggest first giving the animal something with the babys smell on it (a blanket, etc) so they dont get alarmed by the new smell in the house, if possible. It is also suggested that you try to keep your pets routine the same as much as possible, and that you greet the pet first without the baby when you arrive home with your new child. Basically, you want the pet to interact positively with the baby, so you will want to reward and encourage positive interactions, and at first you might want to limit the time the pet and the baby spend actively together. Bring the baby to sit with the pet, etc (with you holding the baby, of course), for small bursts, extending them over time, as the pet gets used to the baby.\n","\t [3] \t\t 14.4 \t\t Excellent answer by Mick. Adding to his answer: Wash clothing, bedding, towels, etc., normally but with the addition of OxiClean or other H2O2 additive. These additives aid in the breakdown of the proteins in the saliva, thus alleviating allergic response. Adding this preparation to rug cleaning solution to wet-clean area rugs will go far to reduce potential allergens. Add 1 part dry powder to 3 parts hot water, stir to dissolve powder and add solution to rug cleaning solution. Use this liquid in the reservoir of your rug cleaner. I use a portable Bissell Little Green with excellent results. While the process of removing allergens from your home is time-consuming and laborious, as long as you keep pets out of your house, it has to be done infrequently.\n","LLM 대답>>:\n","정보가 부족해서 답을 할 수 없습니다.\n"]}],"source":["\n","messages = [\n","{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"낙타를 키우고 싶은데 어떤 준비가 필요한가요?\"}\n","]\n","\n","conversation_search(messages, persona_function_calling, tools)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":31,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2746,"status":"ok","timestamp":1706099782745,"user":{"displayName":"Jaekyoung(배재경)","userId":"15272867038869688191"},"user_tz":-540},"id":"S-37JZMAJSK7","outputId":"e99ce57d-1b5f-4674-b4b5-80d8fe718c26"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["LLM 대답>>:\n","저는 반려 동물 전문가로서, 반려 동물에 관한 질문이나 도움을 드리기 위해 여기 있습니다. 반려 동물에 대해 궁금한 점이 있으면 언제든지 물어보세요!\n"]}],"source":["# 지식에 대한 질문이 아닌 경우\n","\n","messages = [\n","{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"저는 고양이를 입양하고 싶은데, 최근에 청각장애가 있는 고양이를 만났어요. 조금 걱정이 되네요. 특별히 고려해야 할 점이 있나요?\"},\n","{\"role\": \"assistant\", \"content\": \"청각장애가 있는 고양이를 입양하는 것은 독특하고 보람찬 경험이 될 수 있습니다. 이들은 일반적으로 안전한 실내 환경과 명확한 시각적 의사소통이 필요합니다. 특별히 걱정되는 점이 있나요?\"},\n","{\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": \"그런데 너는 누구니?\"}\n","]\n","\n","#conversation_search(messages, persona_function_calling, tools, {\"type\": \"function\", \"function\": {\"name\": \"searcher\"}})\n","conversation_search(messages, persona_function_calling, tools)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Ocgzw_rKxKAn"},"source":["#Reference"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4by_4X6tvaX6"},"source":["## Required Package\n","\n","openai==1.7.2 <br>\n","colbert-ir==0.2.14 <br>\n","torch==1.13.1 <br>\n","faiss-gpu==1.7.0\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"accelerator":"GPU","colab":{"gpuType":"T4","provenance":[],"toc_visible":true},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.19"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
